Last weekend I've got some time to work on our model engine again. I reviewed the original control panel I designed some time ago:

> As I wrote before this is all fake. Very loosely inspired in some real engines, but not following anything in particular.

The [Institute of Flight](https://www.futureofflight.org) here in the Pacific Northwest organizes workshops for 3D printing. Also, on Mondays, you can simply go the [Maker space](https://www.futureofflight.org/3d-makerspace) and print stuff for a small fee. (If you are a member, you just pay the materials). So we took our design and gave it a try:

That's a ~30 min, $5 print. The printer is a [Flashforge Dreamer](http://www.flashforge-usa.com/shop/3d-printers/flashforge-dreamer-dual-extrusion-3d-printer.html), and the piece was printed on 0.2mm resolution.

The stuff below the handle are supporting structures that the printing software will automatically generate and are easy to trim.

I like (very much) [TinkerCAD](http://tinkercad.com) for simpler designs. Portable, easy to learn, fun to use. The Maker space coach at the Institute of Flight was kind enough to give me a quick [Sketchup](https://www.sketchup.com/) tour, and that seems a little bit more powerful for more complex designs. So, I added it to the (ever growing) list of "things to learn".
