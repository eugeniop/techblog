For a long time I wanted to build a steam engine. I've always been fascinated by trains in general, and steam engines in particular.

Long time ago I encountered [Roundhouse Engineering Ltd.]() a fine company in the UK that sells larger scale live steam models that run on 32mm (SM32) or 45mm gauge (G) tracks. But they also sell kits (for some of their engines).

On my last visit to London I decided to try one out, and purchased Katie's chassis, valves and wheels.
