I was able to make some progress this weekend, my parents were visiting so I enrolled them. We completed the frame:

We completed the wiring connecting each paralellogram. Notice we couldn't use the standard connectors, because each pair of triangles is separate from each other:

We did a quick test with the actual Nanoleafs, confirming that all wires are right:

And last, we put it all together:

I love it!

### Next steps:

1. Build a frame (wooden likely so it is sturdy)
2. Paint
3. Hang!

### Future

Nanoleafs can be _programmed_ and it ships with multiple integrations. One of them is with [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/), which opens the door to innumerable options. There's also a (beta) [API](https://forum.nanoleaf.me/docs/openapi). Stay tuned!
