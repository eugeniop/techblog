This is a small project I've been working on for a while to track sleep and mood. It is pretty obvious from our own personal experience how important sleep is. And that bad sleep patterns lead to a pretty poor general wellbeing and mood.

Building on the experience of creating the [Marcus Aurelius daily quote app I described on my previous post](/post/2017-07-15-using-twilio-and-webtask-to-become-a-better-stoic.markdown), I decided to use SMS as the main interaction method. Why? because it is so simple:

1. No apps to install / update
2. Works on any phone
3. Universally available

## Architecture

The solution follows the same design I used for Marcus' quotes. It consists of:

1. A Twilio "app" that receives SMS requests and calls an API to store events.
2. A database where events are stored.
3. An API to query the database and create new events.
4. A simple webpage that shows a few graphs with historical and statistical data. 

The last piece was a lot of fun to build. Had to refresh my college statistics knowledge I had not used recently. Good thing my son Agustin is currently studying linear regressions, so he helped me out test some of my datasets.

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTf9QVyxW1bTYd3zoNDv4ZnMG9nv6zpAYtW4dwh1S0ZF5TvaggAXJVoyjfaT6ih85vrsy89Wp7ZN4d6/pub?w=925&h=247)

Once again, the **database** is an [mlab](https://mlab.com) free tier database. I'm actually reusing the same I used for Marcus' quotes. Different collection.

The **API**, the **Twilio app** and the **webpage** are [Webtask](https://webtask.io) based systems (the same webtask actually, with different endpoints). And of course, everything is secured with **Auth0**.

### Twilio app

As before, the twilio SMS number is configured to call my webtask on the `/sms` endpoint:

![](/media/twilio-maq.png)

This time I got a little bit fancier, and I built a very simple "menu" system that is a little bit more sophisticated. It starts with an array with an element per menu option:

```js
var menu = [
    {
      name: "New sleep record",
      help: '"s {hours} {comment}" {hours} are total hours slept (decimals are OK: 5.5). {comment} is an optional note.',
      verbs:["s", "sleep", "sl"],
      handler: (done) => {
          saveSleep(MONGO_URL,phone,command,done);
      }
    },
    {
      name: "Mood",
      help: '"m {1-5} {comment}" {mood} from 1 to 5. 1:bad, 5:great. {comment} is an optional note.',
      verbs: ["m", "mood","md"],
      handler: (done) => {
          saveMood(MONGO_URL,phone,command,done);
      },
    },
];
```

* `verbs` identifies the command the system will recognize. In the example above, the first option in the menu is `record new sleep` and `s`, `sleep` and `sl` are all synonyms. `Sleep for 7 hours` for example, can be expressed as `s 7` or `sleep 7`.
* `handler` is the function to call when the command is identified.
* `help` is well...a help text.

Now I can have a couple generic functions that work on the menu, and allows me to quickly add new commands easily.

```js
function findMenuEntry(menu,verb){
  var menuEntry = _.find(menu,(m)=>{
                        return m.verbs.indexOf(verb)>-1
                     });
  if(!menuEntry){
    menuEntry = {
      handler: (done) =>{
        done(new Error("Invalid commmand"), util.format("Command not recognized [%s]\n%s", verb, "For help, send 'h' command."));      
      }  
    };
  }
  
  return menuEntry;
}
```

Notice the function returns a `dummy` entry if no entry is found. This simplifies the `main` function logic.

```
/*------------ Twilio App Main ---------------*/
server.post('/sms', (req, res, next) => {
  
  if(twilio.validateExpressRequest(req,req.webtaskContext.data.TW_AUTH_TOKEN, {protocol: 'https'}) === false){
     return next('Unauthorized. Only accepts requests from Twilio.');
  }

  const { MONGO_URL } = req.webtaskContext.data;

  //Commands on SMS are of the format: {c} {args}
  var { verb, command } = parseInput(req);
  var phone = req.body.From;

  var menu = [
    {
      name: 'New sleep record',
      help:
        '"s {hours} {comment}" {hours} are total hours slept (decimals are OK: 5.5). {comment} is an optional note.',
      verbs: ['s', 'sleep', 'sl'],
      handler: done => {
        saveSleep(MONGO_URL, phone, command, done);
      },
    },
    {
      name: 'Mood',
      help:
        '"m {1-5} {comment}" {mood} from 1 to 5. 1:bad, 5:great. {comment} is an optional note.',
      verbs: ['m', 'mood', 'md'],
      handler: done => {
        saveMood(MONGO_URL, phone, command, done);
      },
    },
    {
      name: 'Help',
      help: 'Get help on command. e.g. "h mood"',
      verbs: ['h', 'help'],
      handler: done => {
        //help
        if (!command) {
          return done(null, buildHelp(menu));
        }
        var menuEntry = findMenuEntry(menu, command);
        if (menuEntry) {
          done(null, menuEntry.help);
        } else {
          done(
            null,
            util.format(
              'Invalid command: [%s]\nAvailable commands:\n%s',
              command,
              buildHelp(menu)
            )
          );
        }
      },
    }
  ];

  var menuEntry = findMenuEntry(menu, verb);
  menuEntry.handler((e, msg) => {
    if (e) {
      msg = util.format('ERROR: %s', msg);
    }
    sendSMSResponse(res, msg);
  });
});

```

The `help` command builds automatically too:

```js
function buildHelp(menu){
  return _.map(menu,(m)=>{return m.verbs[0]+" : "+m.name}).join('\n'); 
}
```
> I love `lodash` :-) 

With this in place, I can add new commands very easily. But I think I've mentioned that already, haven't I? 

#### Securing your Twilio endpoint

This is easy, I'm using the same approach of checking the Twilio header `X-Twilio-Signature` (using the helper library):

```
...
if(twilio.validateExpressRequest(req,req.webtaskContext.data.TW_AUTH_TOKEN, {protocol: 'https'}) === false){
  return next('Unauthorized. Only accepts requests from Twilio.');
}
...

```

This prevents anyone from calling the `sms` endpoint, except Twilio itself. As they are the only ones that can generate the signature in the header.

### The API & Website

Using `express` with Webtask is straight-forward with the use of the `Webtask-tools` module. This wires up Express with the main WT runtime:

```
import Webtask from 'webtask-tools';
const server = express();
...
module.exports = Webtask.fromExpress(server);
```

API endpoints look very familiar and easy to implement, and it follows _REST-ish_ principles:

> The purists among you would likely point out how this is not really even _REST-ish_. I get it. 

```js
server.get('/subscribers',auth,(req,res,next)=>{
    const { MONGO_URL } = req.webtaskContext.data;
    getSubscribers(MONGO_URL,{},(err,subscribers) => {
      if(err) return next(err);
      res.json(subscribers);
  });
});


server.get('/data/:phone/summary/:days?',auth,(req,res,next) => {
  
  const { MONGO_URL } = req.webtaskContext.data;
  const phone = req.params.phone;

  var days = getDays(req.params.days); //max is 120

  getSummary(MONGO_URL, phone, days, (err, summary) => {
    if (err) {
      return next(err);
    }
    summary.trendReportUrl = util.format(
      'https://%s/tracker/reports/trend/%s/%d',
      req.hostname,
      phone,
      days
    );
    summary.correlationReportUrl = util.format(
      'https://%s/tracker/reports/correlation/%s/%d',
      req.hostname,
      phone,
      days
    );
    res.json(summary);
  });
});
```

> A more sophisticated API would likely benefit from more specialized frameworks, but Express is so simple that here it works great.

#### Securing the API

To secure the API Iâ€™m defining the resource in Auth0, and configured a middleware (`auth`) that simply validates the presence of a valid `access_token`. Regular stuff, nothing fancy.


## Fun with Stats

Now that we have data, it is time to extract some insights from the stream of events. The app is designed so you capture a stream of mutliple events throughout the day. For example:

1. When you wake up: `S 8 woke up once` and `m 5 feeling great`
2. You drive a brutal commute: `m 3 long commute`
3. You had lunch with an old friend: `m 4 reconnected with friend`
4. Your kid is sick, you pick him up frm school: `m 2 billy is sick`
5. You go back to sleep: `m 4 watched a great movie after putting billy to bed`

In this hypothetical day, you slept **8 hours** and mood ranged from **2-5**, with an average of **3.6**. I was also interested in finding any correlations between `mood` and `sleep` so I needed a way of analyzing the stream. 

All this is performed by the `getSummary` function, that will return an object like this (called with a 5 day window):

```js
{
  "mood":{
    "min":2.5,
    "max":3.5,
    "avg":3.22,
    "median":3.5,
    "samples":9,
    "moodAvgByLocalTimeDay":[3.25,3.33,3.5,2.5,3]
  },
  "sleep":{
    "min":6,
    "max":8,
    "avg":7,
    "median":7,
    "samples":5,
    "sleepAvgByLocalTimeDay":[6.5,7.5,8,6,7]
  },
  "correlation":{
    "r2":0.72,
    "linear_regression":{
        "m":0.41600000000000364,
        "b":0.20399999999997442}
  },
  "trendReportUrl":"https://{BASE_WT_URL}.webtask.io/tracker/reports/trend/+12342341234/5",
  "correlationReportUrl":"https://{BASE_WT_URL}.run.webtask.io/tracker/reports/correlation/+12342341234/5"
}
```

Most properties are self-descriptive. But here are a few highlights in this example:

* The `moodAvgByLocalTimeDay` is an array of `average` mood for each day, in the users' TZ. 
* `sleepAvgByLocalTimeDay` is correspondent with the `moodAvgByLocalTimeDay`. Meaning that the values correspond to each day.
* The `correlation` object describes the linear regression parameters for the values in the arrays. `r2` is the [coefficient of determination](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination) and measures the degree of `correlation` between the 2 sets: a value of 1 means "perfect" linear relationship between the 2 series. `m` and `b` are the parameters of the line for the correlation (`y = m.x + b`)
* The last 2 properties are convenient links to the generated HTML reports.

I use these values to render a couple of simple plots on HTML (using the awesome [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/)):

#### Correlation

These are fake of course. I always sleep very well :-). More on these charts below.

### Generating the summary data

Here's my "getSummary" function:

```js
/*
  mongo: mongo connections string
  phone: phone to look events for
  days: window of events to look for (the system will cap it at 120 days)
*/
function getSummary(mongo, phone, days, done) {
  
  getSubscribers(mongo, { phone: phone }, (err, subscribers) => {
    
    if(err){ return done(err); }
    if(subscribers.length === 0){ return done(new Error("Subscriber not found")); }

    //Defaulted to 
    var tz = 'America/Los_Angeles';

    if(subscribers[0].tz) {
      tz = subscribers[0].tz;
    }

    getData(
      mongo,
      {
        phone: phone,
        createdAt: {
          $gte: new Date(new Date().getTime() - days * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000),
        },
      },
      (err, data) => {
        if (err) {
          return done(err);
        }

        //No data, no errors, returns empty object
        if(data.length === 0) {
          return done(null, {});
        }

        //Group events by type (mood and sleep)
        var events = _.groupBy(data, (i)=>i.event);
        
        var sleep = events.sleep;
        var mood = events.mood;

        //Get hours & mood arrays from events
        var sleep_hours = _.map(sleep, (m)=>m.hours);
        var mood_mood = _.map(mood, (m)=>m.mood)

        var ss = require('simple-statistics@4.1.1');

        var stats = {
          mood: {
            min: ss.min(mood_mood),
            max: ss.max(mood_mood),
            avg: ss.mean(mood_mood),
            median: ss.median(mood_mood),
            samples: mood.length,
          },
          sleep: {
            min: ss.min(sleep_hours),
            max: ss.max(sleep_hours),
            avg: ss.mean(sleep_hours),
            median: ss.median(sleep_hours),
            samples: sleep.length,
          },
        };

        //Group events by Day (adjusted for TZ)
        var sleepByDay = _.groupBy(sleep, (i) => moment(i.createdAt)
                                                      .tz(tz)
                                                      .format('M-D'));
                                                      
        var moodByDay = _.groupBy(mood, (i) => moment(i.createdAt)
                                                    .tz(tz)
                                                    .format('M-D'));
        
        //Find days with BOTH mood and sleep
        var daysWithBothSleepAndMood = _.intersection(_.map(sleepByDay,(i,k)=>k),_.map(moodByDay,(i,k)=>k));
        
        var sleepAvgByDay={};
        
        _.forEach(sleepByDay, (s,k) => {
          var avg = ss.mean(_.map(s,(i)=>i.hours));
          sleepAvgByDay[k] = Math.round(avg * 100 / s.length) / 100
        });

        stats.sleep.sleepAvgByLocalTimeDay = _.map(daysWithBothSleepAndMood,(d)=>sleepAvgByDay[d]);

        var moodAvgByDay={};
  
        _.forEach(moodByDay, (s,k) => {
          var avg = ss.mean(_.map(s,(i)=>i.mood));
          moodAvgByDay[k] = Math.round(avg * 100 / s.length) / 100
        });
        
        stats.mood.moodAvgByLocalTimeDay = _.map(daysWithBothSleepAndMood,(d)=>moodAvgByDay[d]);;

        //Simple correlation
        var samples = _.zip(stats.sleep.sleepAvgByLocalTimeDay, stats.mood.moodAvgByLocalTimeDay);
        var lr = ss.linearRegression(samples);
        var interpolation_line = ss.linearRegressionLine(lr);
        var r2 =
          Math.round(ss.rSquared(samples, interpolation_line) * 100) / 100;

        stats.correlation = {
          r2: r2,
          linear_regression: lr,
        };

        done(null, stats);
      }
    );
  });
}
```

It is easier to visualize what this function does with a simple diagram:

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vSb4frcinNzxaCBk6sIJ1-H5jZmmrvyftbC4s1XR4wMg2EOqXBMbREO3N25JaWTxitSjdsCV-11-v4f/pub?w=960&h=660)

1. In the first stage, I obtain all events from the database (using the `days` parameter to filter the time window we are interested in)
2. Then I group events by `type`. It is very simple then to obtain regular stats values from these 2 collections streams. A simple `_.map` to extract the values from the events (e.g. `_.map(sleep,(s)=>s.hours)` returns the array of hours in the sleep event stream)
3. Then I group again by day (adjusted for TZ), and I find the **intersection** between the 2 groups. In the example above, there are 5 `sleep` events, but only 4 `mood`. So the intersection will be the set `{1,2,3,4}`. This will be used for the correlation computations, where I need 2 arrays with corresponding values. 

This method extensively uses the `simple-statistics` module that ships with a ton of very useful statistics functions.

### Wait...what about performance?

As you can easily deduct from the code above, this implementation results on many iterations over the same datasets (e.g. all the `mean`, `min`, `max`, etc.). I guess I could compute all those values on a single pass over the stream, but...quite frankly, I'm not interested in optimizing performance at the moment. The app limits queries to just 120 days at most, which would result in ~500 events. This is a relatively small set in practice, and I'm the only user at the moment :-). 

> _"Early optimization is the source of all evil"_. 

One area to explore, and that I'm curious to learn more about, is how much of this can be pushed to mongo. Mongo does have a "pipeline" with complex operations: aggregation, map/reduce, etc. but I have not fully explored. Will be added to the "todo".

I do intend to measure a little bit and find out though. `simple-statistics` looks lean and well implemented, but somewhat rigorous for my humble needs.

### Generating HTML reports

The trend report is simple HTML at the moment. I have not fully secured these pages, so I have disabled them. But I'm using a trick that [Tomek](https://tomasz.janczuk.org/) taught me. I'm storing the entire App/API/web app in a single Webtask, so the HTML templates are embedded and rendered using [ejs](https://github.com/tj/ejs):


```js

      window.myLine = new Chart(ctx, config);
    };

*/
}

function hereDoc(f) {
  return f
    .toString()
    .replace(/^[^\/]+\/\*!?/, '')
    .replace(/\*\/[^\/]+$/, '');
}
```

and then the function to render (shortened):

```js
server.get('/reports/trend/:phone/:days?', (req, res, next) => {
  var phone = req.params.phone;
  var days = getDays(req.params.days);
  const { MONGO_URL } = req.webtaskContext.data;

  getSubscribers(MONGO_URL, { phone: phone }, (err, subscribers) => {
    var tz = 'America/Los_Angeles';

    if (subscribers.length > 0 && subscribers[0].tz) {
      tz = subscribers[0].tz;
    }

    getData(
      MONGO_URL,
      {
        phone: phone,
