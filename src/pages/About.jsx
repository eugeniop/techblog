              This is my personal technical blog. I'm Eugenio. A problem solver. My formal background is in electrical engineering and computer science. But I am also a learner and am curious about almost everything. I wake in the morning in awe of the world we live in, and grateful for the privilege of living here. I was the co-founder and the CEO of <strong>Auth0</strong>, the company I founded with my brother in arms Matias Woloski.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">I love tinkering and building stuff. I work/play with software, hardware, tools, houses, cars, bikes, wood, metal, teams, bricks, farms, pots and pans. 

I like lifting heavy things, because then everything seems light. I ride bikes and row boats. I love traveling around the world and history. When in Rome, I order gelato.
